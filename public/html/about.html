	<h4>Education</h4>
	<p>
		This is why we're here at BYU, right?  But beyond the learning we do in the classroom, there are 
		other topics that are important to helping us transition into the workplace.  Plus, it's fun to 
		learn cool stuff!  Activites include:
	</p>
	<p>
		Monthly Workshops on various topics
	</p>
	<p>
		ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest
	</p>
	<p>
		Graduate School Information
	</p>

	<h4>Service</h4>
	<p>
		We are all blessed with talents and abilities and now BYU ACM is providing opportunites to use those to help others!  At least once a semester we have our Weekend of Code service project where
		we all get together and work on a project.  There is always food and we all learn a lot about a new programming paradigm or language we weren't familiar with before.
